# Setting the Right Incentives

While this topic comes up in virtually any scenario that involves managing stakeholder interest, there were several key points that I took away from our class in the context of software development.   I particularly want to focus on the importance of setting the right incentives for in-house dev teams – from hiring through to managing people and teams.  This skill is even more important in a world where supply and demand are so skewed, and you are in an unenviable position of where retaining good devs is **both** very difficult and very important.  Finding a way to draw them into your company or engage them in a project takes understanding how to properly communicate and incentivize them.  


**The Hiring Process:** Incentives can vary as you move up and down the growth curve from startups with a few developers, to large companies with large development teams. Some considerations include: 

- Realizing how to best structure contracts based on the implications of equity-/salary- based compensation.     
- Knowing how to offer flexibility to developers based on their expertise, or work habits.  For example, you might allow a developer being hired into a CTO role at your startup the flexibility to determine which framework, database structure, etc. to use rather than imposing those choices on them. 

**Managing developers and developer teams:**  In addition, good managers know how to structure projects and teams based on personalities, and put devs in situations that lead to better quality, efficiency and production.  At the end of the day, like any other situation, it’s about managing people and reacting to situations as much as anything else.
